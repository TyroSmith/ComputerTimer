Computer Timer v2.0 by Tyro Smith
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome!
This is a program you can use to set yourself a time limit on the computer for
whatever reason including:
1. Not Getting Fat
2. Going to an appointment
3. Getting back to work
4. Reminding you to do something not relating to a computer such as calling a
relative

There are two versions you can use: Timer_V2 and Timer_V2_WithVoice

Both of them are the same except that Timer_V2_WithVoice will say what you want
to be reminded right before the pop-up box appears

I made this program with VBS so it will only work on a Windows computer.

How to Use:
1. Open the program
2. Enter the your time limit in minutes
3. Press Enter
3. Enter what you want the program to remind you. Ex: "Get up and do 10 push-ups"
4. Do whatever you want to do, not having to look at the clock repeatedly
5. After your time is up a pop-up box will appear with your reminder
6. Press Enter on your keyboard or "Okay" on the pop-up
7. Another pop-up will appear asking you for a command
8. You can leave it blank or here are commands you can use:
	sleep = puts your computer to sleep
	shutdown = shutdowns your computer
	log off = logs you off your computer
	lock = locks your username

I hope this program fits your needs!
You can use this any way you want. Including redistributing or modifying it.
Please give credit to me, though if you do redistibute it.
